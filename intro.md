# Curating Idioms for Dependently-Typed Programming

Dependently-typed programming provides programmers with an express environment in which to specify and enforce their programmes properties.
Based on a simple idea that types can depend on values, dependently-typed languages such as Agda and Idris (Coq too) have grown in popularity and ease-of-use.
As the number of programmers using such languages increases we evidently begin to see common idiomatic constructs in, and across, the languages.
To ensure that these idioms are not lost in time like tears in the rain, we have begun to curate these design patterns in a pattern library.

Design Patterns are a well-known software engineering practice to encode software engineering practises.
Whilst there have been attempts at formalising patterns we do not seek to formally represent the patterns here.
Rather, we view patterns in their original guise of a documentation format to document the pairs of problems and solutions and the contexts in which they appear.

A aim of the project is to present these patterns in formats suitable for both novices and expert programmers.
This is a library for engineers and engineers come in all shapes and sizes.
