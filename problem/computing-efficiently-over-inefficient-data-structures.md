# Efficient Computation Over Inefficient Structure

The shape of data structures such as `Nat`, `List`, and `Vect` makes them easy to reason about, but innefficient to compute with.

For example, if we want to split a list or compute the parity of Nats then if we are not careful the operations will be linear where they could be more efficient.
